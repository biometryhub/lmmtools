##' BarleyData: multi-environment trials
##'
##'
##' The South Australian Barley Program conducted a total of 24 Stage 3
##' trials over two years, 2006 and 2007.  Randomised complete block
##' designs were used for all trials, with two or three blocks or
##' replicates of the varieties.  Within years, the number of common lines
##' was approximately 180, while between years approximately 50 lines were
##' in common across pairs of trials.  There were a total of 322 lines
##' across all the trials, but there was no pedigree or genomic
##' information.  The aim of the trials was to examine yield performance.
##' The variables are as follows:
##'
##' \itemize{
##' \item Site.  the site factor.
##' \item Stage.  The stage of the trialling process.
##' \item Year.  The year of the trial.
##' \item Column.  The column that a plot is in.
##' \item Row.  The row a plot is in.
##' \item Genotype.  The variety in a plot.
##' \item yield.  The yield in tonnes per hectare.
##' \item lcol.  A mean centred linear column effect.
##' \item lrow.  A mean centred linear row effect.
##' \item Block.  The block a plot is in.
